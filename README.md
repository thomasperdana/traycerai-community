## Features

## Triggering Analysis: Manual vs. Automated

Traycer provides flexibility in how you trigger code analysis:

1. **Automatic Analysis** (default)
   Traycer continuously tracks your activities and performs analysis in real-time. Analysis is triggered automatically by events such as saving your work.
2. **Manually Triggered Analysis**
   This allows users to initiate the analysis at their convenience through various methods, providing flexibility and control.
   - **Analyze File:** This option comprehensively reviews the entire file, regardless of recent changes. It checks the code for consistency, errors, and adherence to coding standards.
   - **Re-Analyze File:** This option behaves similarly to `Analyze File` but is useful for re-evaluating the entire file without evaluating what has already been analyzed in a previous analysis.
   - **Analyze Changes in File:** This option focuses solely on recently modified functions in the currently open file. It's ideal for quickly verifying modifications without analyzing unchanged parts of the file.
   - **Analyze Changes in Workspace:** This option reviews all modified files in the workspace, providing a comprehensive analysis of recent changes across multiple files.

### Switching Between Manual and Automated Analysis

Configure your preferences to switch between manual and automated analysis modes.

#### Different ways to switch between Manual and Automated Analysis

1. **Using Command Palette: -**

   - Open the Command Palette in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+P` OR `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac).
   - Type and select `Traycer: Enable Auto Analysis` OR `Traycer: Disable Auto Analysis`.

2. **Extension Settings Page:**

   - Go to the Traycer extension settings page in VS Code.
   - Change the "Traycer: Execution Mode" setting to "Manual" or "Auto".

### Manually Triggered Analysis

This allows users to have full control over when the analysis runs. Users can trigger the analysis process manually, making it useful for reviewing and refining code at specific points in the development workflow.

#### Different ways to trigger Analysis manually

1. **Editor Toolbar**: Click the Traycer icon on the top editor toolbar to trigger analysis on the current file.

   ![Editor Toolbar](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ed8f703-1a36-4d8d-8153-96c8e6f1c93a)

2. **Right-click Menu**: Right-click anywhere in the code file and select Traycer > `Analyze File`, `Re-Analyze File`, `Analyze Changes in File`, or `Analyze Changes in Workspace`.

3. **Command Palette**: Run `Traycer: Analyze File`, `Traycer: Re-Analyze File`, `Traycer: Analyze Changes in File`, or `Traycer: Analyze Changes in Workspace` from the command palette by using `Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Cmd + Shift + P`.

### Checking Analysis Status

To check the status of your analysis, **hover** over the Traycer icon. It will display the count of running analyses, such as "Traycer in-flight analysis: X". If the count is 0, it means there are no analyses currently running.

## Comments & Replies

Traycer adds comments to your code, suggesting improvements and highlighting potential issues such as bugs, performance, security, and clarity. These comments provide actionable insights to help you refine your code, maintain high standards, and address problems early in the development process. Additionally, you can reply to comments to engage in a conversation with Traycer, allowing you to discuss and resolve issues directly within the context of each comment.

![Comments & Replies](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b27f2de5-14f2-4561-9724-08c1ab5b772f)

### (A) Navigator

To navigate and manage comments in Traycer, follow these steps:

1. Open the side panel by clicking on the Traycer icon in the activity bar.
2. Browse through the list of comments categorized by labels such as `bugs`, `performance`, `security`, and `clarity`.
3. Use the **Wand icon** (ðŸª„) next to a comment to directly apply the suggested fix, if the icon is present. Some comments may not have a suggestion.
4. Use the search box to find comments by text, filename, or file path.

### (B) Traycer Comment

The Comment Detailed View in Traycer provides an in-depth look at each comment, offering context and actionable insights to help improve your code. Here are some key features:

1. **Code Snippet Display with Diff:** The comment includes a relevant code snippet showing the differences between your current code and the suggested changes from Traycer AI. This helps you understand the exact context of the comment and the proposed improvements.

2. **Reply and Discuss:** You can engage in a conversation with Traycer by replying to comments. This allows you to discuss the issues directly within the context of each comment, making it easier to resolve problems and refine your code.

3. **Quick Fix:** The Wand icon allows you to directly apply the suggested fix, streamlining the process of addressing issues. If a comment does not have a suggested fix, the Wand icon will not be present.

4. **Comment Deletion:** The Bin icon allows you to delete the entire comment along with its conversation.

5. **Feedback Options:** You can give a thumbs up or thumbs down to provide feedback on the comment. This helps improve the accuracy and usefulness of future comments.

6. **Actionable Insights:** Each comment suggests improvements or highlights potential issues such as bugs, performance, security, and clarity. The detailed view provides a clear explanation of the issue and how to address it.

## Learnings

Learnings enable Traycer to capture user preferences and code-relevant insights from your interactions. When you reply to comments, Traycer analyzes your responses to identify preferences or learnings, saving them to improve future analyses and recommendations.

### How It Works

- **Automatic Detection**: Traycer scans your replies for indications of coding style preferences, tool configurations, or best practices you follow.
- **Personalized Experience**: The saved learnings enable Traycer to tailor its feedback and suggestions to align with your specific needs and preferences.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Ongoing interactions help Traycer better understand your coding habits and requirements.

### Managing Learnings

- **Accessing Learnings**: Click on the Learnings icon in the menu to view your saved learnings.

  ![Access Learnings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7912f3e5-a4f6-4bfb-9ad5-b3fd5916367f)

  See the list of all the learnings you've accumulated:

  ![Learnings List](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/465159dc-8b42-4186-91cf-17a9d9296835)

- **Deleting Learnings**: Click the Bin icon next to the learning you wish to delete.
- **Adding Learnings Manually**: You can manually add new learnings by clicking the Plus icon. Specify preferences or insights directly without waiting for Traycer to capture them in your replies.
- **Privacy Control**: Your privacy is important. Traycer provides a setting in the [Platform](https://platform.traycer.ai/settings) where you can opt out of the Learnings feature anytime. Opting out will delete all existing learnings. Note that the learning feature is on by default.

## Analysis History
